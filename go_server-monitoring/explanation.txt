The demon scans the processes at regular intervals and if the process data shows change compared to the last state the change is written to local monitoring file in a standardized format. If the overseer polls the demon then the demon sends the states of those process where the state changed since the last scan, or only an empty object as a heartbeat. If a process is gone, that is considered a change.
